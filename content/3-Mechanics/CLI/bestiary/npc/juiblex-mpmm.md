*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 160*  

Called the Faceless Lord and the Oozing Hunger in ancient grimoires, Juiblex is demon lord of slime and ooze, a noxious creature that doesn't care about the plots and schemes of others of its kind. It exists only to consume, digesting and transforming living matter into more of itself.

A true horror, Juiblex is a mass of bubbling slime, swirling black and green, with glaring red eyes floating and shifting within it. It can rise up like a 20-foot hill, lashing out with dripping pseudopods to drag victims into its bulk. Those consumed by Juiblex are obliterated.

## Juiblex's Lair

Juiblex's principal lair is known as the Slime Pits, a realm that Juiblex shares with [Zuggtmoy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zuggtmoy-mpmm.md) (who also appears in this book). This layer of the Abyss, which is also known as Shedaklah, is a bubbling morass of fetid sludge. The landscape is covered in vast expanses of caustic slimes, and strange organic forms rise from the oceans of ooze at Juiblex's command.

Juiblex's challenge rating is 24 (62,000 XP) when encountered in its lair.
