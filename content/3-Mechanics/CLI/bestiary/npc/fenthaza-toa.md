      \ Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic\
      \ damage and is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) of the\
      \ manifestation, believing it to be real. Fenthaza must concentrate to maintain\
      \ the illusion (as if [concentrating](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target\
      \ can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion\
      \ on a success, or taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failure."
