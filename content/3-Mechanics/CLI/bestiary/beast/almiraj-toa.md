# [Almiraj](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\beast/almiraj-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 211*  

An almiraj (pronounced AWL-meer-ahj) is a large, timid rabbit with a 1-foot-long spiral horn emerging from its forehead, not unlike the horn of a unicorn. If driven to attack, it tries to spear enemies with its horn.

Almiraj were brought to Chult long ago by merchants of the distant land of Zakhara. Skilled at evading predators, these creatures have flourished throughout the tropical peninsula. They live in earthen burrows and can be captured and domesticated. With the DM's permission, the [find familiar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell can summon an almiraj.
