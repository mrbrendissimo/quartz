# [Tomb Guardian](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/tomb-guardian-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 127*  

Adventurers who have perished inside the tomb are stitched together by tomb dwarves and bolted into suits of armor. Once complete, these shambling golems are released into the tomb to hunt intruders.

A tomb guardian is a flesh golem clad in plate armor, giving it AC 17
