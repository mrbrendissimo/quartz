*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 231*  

A stone juggernaut is a rolling construct imbued with enough awareness to avoid obvious dangers such as open pits and chasms. It trundles across open battlefields or rolls down dungeon corridors, crushing anyone in its path. Every stone juggernaut has a unique shape and appearance. One might resemble an elephant with bejeweled tusks, while another might look like a scowling demon with flaming eyes and obsidian teeth.

A stone juggernaut is fast, but it lacks maneuverability and can move in only one direction on its turn. It poses little danger to creatures it can't crush beneath its rollers. Its best tactic is to slam into a creature, knock it [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone), and then roll over it.
