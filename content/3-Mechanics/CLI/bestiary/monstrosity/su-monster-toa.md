# [Su-monster](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/su-monster-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 232*  

Su-monsters are cunning, wicked primates that inhabit forsaken wilderness areas and caves. Adults stand 5 feet tall and have long prehensile tails. Although they can grasp tools and weapons with their tails or clawed feet, su-monsters prefer to rend prey with their claws. Adult su-monsters can also project blasts of psionic energy that leave enemies [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) and unable to flee or defend themselves.

A su-monster sleeps while hanging upside down by its tail. While awake, it can also unleash a devastating attack from that position, rending with all four of its claws.

Su-monsters communicate silently by using their prehensile tails to make gestures. They typically kill more than they can eat, burying the leftovers and marking their location with the victim's possessions.
