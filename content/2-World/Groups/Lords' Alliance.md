# GM Notes

The Lords' Alliance is a loose conglomerate at best, which each member state perusing their own ends as they see fit. There is no formal hierarchic structure, the Open Lord of Waterdeep is considered to be the overall ruler and arbitrator in any dispute. In times of war, members pool their military might and work together in a conflict, a fact that has been a major contribution to the Sword Coast's stability and independence to this day.

Agents of the Lords' alliance are often soldiers from the member states' militarizes, hand picked for their loyalty and service to their nations. Others are mercenaries who enjoy the high paying and dangerous work offered by the Alliance. Some member are even minor lords themselves, seeking to prove their leadership abilities and combat prowess right wear the action is.
