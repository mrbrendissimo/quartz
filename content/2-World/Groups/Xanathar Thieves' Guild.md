# General

**Select Parent:** `INPUT[suggester(optionQuery(#Category/Hub),optionQuery(#Category/Region)):MyContainer]`

**Select Category:** `INPUT[inlineSelect(option(Knightly Order), option(Religious Order), option(Magic Academy), option(Artisan Guild), option(Merchant Consortium), option(Criminal Syndicate), option(Mercenary Company), option(Noble House), option(Secret Society or Cult), option(Adventurers’ Guild)):MyCategory]`

The Xanathar's Guild is a group of thieves and cutthroats operating out of the bowels of Waterdeep. From its main offices in Skullport, the Xanathar's Guild has access to several portals, with prominent ones leading to an alley in Waterdeep, a rock outcropping near Calimport, and a small Guild-owned warehouse in Westgate.   The Guild is led by an elder beholder called The Xanathar. It is at least the second such creature to claim the title, since it destroyed its predecessor. Few outside the inner circle of Masters know of The Xanathar's nature, because it is reclusive and guarded by undead beholders. Eleven Masters each control one of the Guild's businesses: assassination, blackmail, book-keeping, enforcement, extortion, information gathering, magical defenses, mercenaries, slavery, smuggling, and thievery. Most of the Guild's work involves slavery or thievery.

# Goals

- Amass wealth and power by any means necessary.
- Let no one thwart your efforts.
- Gain influence over important people and organizations.
- Have eyes and ears all over Faerun.

# Membership
Members of the Guild are well trained and skilled in stealth, tactics, and discretion. They have excellent arms and armor, and those who need to use portals as part of their work are usually multiclass spellcasters or at least trained in rudimentary spellcasting. The elite troops that work for the slavers (known as the Hands of the Eye) are all at least 4th level.

# GM Notes

**Beliefs**
- There is no being greater than the Xanathar. He is your key to power and glory.
- By being a part of the Xanathar's network, you too are touched by greatness.
- Everything—and everyone—has a price. And if they don't, they can be disintegrated easily.
